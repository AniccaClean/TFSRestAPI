# TFSRestAPI

The following is an on-going implementation of the [Microsoft TFS Rest API](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/integrate/api/overview) for Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and on-premise Team Foundation Services (TFS) in PowerShell.

## Current State

At the present time, this implementation only supports on-premise TFS, but can easily be modified in the invoke_rest method to utilize your authentication string. 

This project is constantly evolving and will begin a phase of implementing the [PowerShell Best Practices Guidelines](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowershellPracticeAndStyle) before any major, additional functionality is added.
